# Environment Variables Configuration

## Development
Copy `.env` and update with your local settings.

## Production (Vercel)
Set these environment variables in your Vercel project dashboard:

- `VITE_API_URL`: Your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., https://your-project.vercel.app)
- `VITE_MAP_TILE_URL`: OpenStreetMap tile server URL

Note: Vercel automatically sets these during deployment, but you can override them in the dashboard if needed.
